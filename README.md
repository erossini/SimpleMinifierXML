# Simple XML Minifier in C#
I give you my code for a simple XML minifier in C# related to my post "[Simple XML minifier in C#](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/csharp/simple-xml-minifier-in-c/)" on [PureSourceCode](https://www.puresourcecode.com).

So, I was working on a new component for Blazor for [displaying icons and flags](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/blazor/svg-icons-and-flags-for-blazor/). The SVG images are a list of command for drawing a picture in a XML style. As every other XML, the code is indented. So, as humans we can read better the code.

In my specific case, I want to have for each image a string and create a class with all the icons code in SVG (if it is not clear what I mean, see the [post](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/blazor/svg-icons-and-flags-for-blazor/)).

Please leave your comment on my [forum](https://www.puresourcecode.com/forum/).
